## About the Collection

When women of the medieval world got married, they brought with them dowries full of their most precious movable objects: jewelry, clothing, bedding, perfumes; and sometimes real estate property and enslaved women. This project, from Rachel Richman's dissertation on Women's Labor and Property in the Cairo Geniza, helps illustrate the variety between individual dowries.
